# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim

This is mostly basic LazyVim. I added:

- LSPs for python and typescript
- LSP also now works well when using conda environments and gives proper support for all installed packages
- formatting with black and prettier
- both lsp and formatting for json and yaml
- added toggleterm on ctrl + |
- added nvim surround
